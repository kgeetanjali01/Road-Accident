This is a multiclass classification project to classify the severity of road accidents into three categories. This project is based on real-world data, and the dataset is also highly imbalanced. There are three types of injuries in a target variable: minor, severe, and fatal.

Road accidents are the major cause of unnatural deaths around the world. All governments work hard to raise awareness about the rules and regulations that must be followed when driving a vehicle on the road in order to reduce fatalities. Thus, it is necessary to have a mechanism that predicts the severity of such accidents and helps in reducing fatalities.
